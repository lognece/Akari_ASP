# Light (Akari) Project

This was a project for the course Artificial Inteligence at the University of Potsdam. 
The tests were pre-written by the teaching team. My solution you can find here: [light.lp](asp/light.lp).

The instructions that were given for the project are in this file: [light.ipynb](light.ipynb).

The command call for the test is:
* ``python3.8 asp/test.py -e asp/light.lp -i asp/instances -s asp/solutions -t 100``
